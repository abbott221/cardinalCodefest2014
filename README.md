Patient Education and Access

How can you increase medical information sharing across different organizations so you minimize the amount of times a patient has to give their personal information history?

By centralizing medical forms in an already existing government database by associating the forms with a patient's SSN, forms can be standardized and be accessible to all medical personnel. In the interest of a patient's privacy not all information is granted to all professionals. For example, an allerginist has no need to know of broken bones or general injuries, and a dermatologist has no need to know of mental conditions like OCD and depression. Furthermore, many end-users are opposed to this unnecessary disclosure.
    In order to prevent a professional from accessing unnecessary information, permissions are granted from the main database to facilities in order to allow the facility to access specific information only.
